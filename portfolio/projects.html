                                            <p><u>A Game about a Box</u> is a physics based 2D platformer where you take control of a blue box named Boxen. In the game's story, you must return Boxen to 'her place' after being seperated from the rest of the group. Throughout the game you encounter various unique gameplay mechanics, such as crumbling blocks, or turning into various things.</p>

                                                <p><u>A Game about a Box</u> is developed in the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> game engine, specifically, Godot 4.1. The game actually started development in Godot 3.5 but was later upgraded post release of Godot 4.0/<p>
                                                <p>The idea of the game sprouted randomly, much like many of my other projects. This currently remains my most completed game project to date, if you don't count the Scratch projects.</p>
